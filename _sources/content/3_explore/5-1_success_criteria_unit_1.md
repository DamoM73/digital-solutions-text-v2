Make a criteria table for the prescribed criteria, and copy **all** the requirements from the **Must** column. Make a second table for the self-determined criteria and copy **all** the requirements from the **Should** column.

### Making the criteria

For both the prescribed and self-determined requirements, we now need to work out how to measure if they have been achieved. The measure that we use of each requirement is called the criteria.

Criteria should be expressed in the form of a SMART goal. This means the goals need to be:

- **Specific**
  - State what you will do
  - Use verbs
- **Measurable**
  - Provide a way to evaluate
  - Use specific metrics or targets that can be tested
- **Achievable**
  - Within the scope of the problem
  - Is it realistically possible to accomplish or attain
- **Relevant**
  - Makes sense within the project
  - Provides benefit to the user in some way or improves the project or user experience
- **Time bound**
  - State when you will show evidence that this is achieved
  - Be specific on dates, times, phase of the Digital Solutions development phases

These goals can be expanded or modified during the project life-cycle if required.
