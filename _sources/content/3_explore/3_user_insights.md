To ensure that the digital solution is meeting the needs of the user, rather than the needs of the developer, UX professionals employ user personas.

Personas are fictional representations and generalisations of user clusters which identify:

- attitudes
- goals
- behaviours

You should have one or two personas which are the aggregation the most important considerations derived from interviewing target users. If you do not have access to target users, then the personas can be developed using assumptions, competitor analysis and internal stakeholder interviews.
