# Glossary

```{glossary}
abstraction
    a process of reducing complexity to formulate generalised fundamental ideas or concepts removed from specific details or situation, e.g. the idea that a cricket ball is a sphere in the same way that a soccer ball is, or the concept that data can be organised in records made up of fields irrespective of whether the data are numbers, text, images or something else; 
    
    abstraction involves hiding details of an idea, problem or solution that are not relevant to focus on a manageable number of aspects.

accurate
    precise and exact; to the point; consistent with or exactly conforming to a truth, standard, rule, model, convention or known facts; free from error or defect; meticulous; correct in all details.

adept
    very/highly skilled or proficient at something; expert.

adequate
    satisfactory or acceptable in quality or quantity equal to the requirement or occasion.

algorithm
    step-by-step procedures required to solve a problem, e.g. to find the largest number in a list of positive numbers
    - note the first number as the largest
    - look through the remaining numbers in turn, and if a number is larger than the number found in the first step, note it as the largest
    - repeat this process until complete; the last noted number is the largest in the list;

    an algorithm may be described in many ways; pseudocode is often useful in visualising an algorithm

analyse
    dissect to ascertain and examine constituent parts and/or their relationships; break down or examine in order to identify the essential elements, features, components or structure; determine the logic and reasonableness of information; 
    
    examine or consider something in order to explain and interpret it, for the purpose of finding meaning or relationships and identifying patterns, similarities and differences.

app
    a software application with a very specific or narrow purpose designed to run on mobile devices (such as smartphones or tablets), through a web browser or on a personal computer; 
    
    the feature set of an application is limited when compared with a full-featured desktop application for a similar purpose, e.g. a photoediting application has a smaller set of features than an industrystandard photographic suite.

compression
    a process of encoding information using fewer bits, i.e. 0 or 1, than an original representation, to reduce file size, typically using mathematical formulas to remove repeated data, combine related data or simplify data, e.g. a line segment can be represented by the position of the end points instead of every dot on it;

    common examples include:
    - .zip files, which can contain one or more files or folders that have been compressed.
    - .jpg files in digital photography are produced by processing complete (lossless) data from a camera’s sensor through compressing (looking for redundant/unnecessary data) into a smaller file size
    - .mp3 files for audio, which compress an original audio source to reduce the file size significantly but still sound like an exact copy of the original

data validation
    in computer science, ensuring that data inserted into an application satisfies defined formats and other input criteria.

decomposition
    to separate a complex problem into parts to allow a problem to be more easily understood, e.g. to create an interactive story, one can decompose the problem to a list of characters and their characteristics (e.g. clothing), the actions of the characters, the backdrops and the sequence of scenes with reference to which characters, actions and backdrops are involved in each scene; decomposition may be represented in diagrams.

design thinking
    use of strategies for understanding design problems, visualising and generating creative ideas, and analysing and evaluating those ideas that best meet the criteria for success; students use both convergent and divergent thinking skills; divergent thinking supports creativity and the generation of a range of ideas, and convergent thinking supports the selection and generation of a preferred solution

desk checking
    a method used by a human to check the logic of a computer program’s algorithm to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring; this may be done on paper, using a diagram or mentally trying a sample of typical inputs to see what the outputs would be; e.g. to desk check a branching statement `IF age >65 THEN "retire" ELSE "keep working"`, the values for age of `64`, `65` and `66` could be tried to show that `64` and `65` would result in `"keep working"` and `66` in `"retire"` so that it could be decided if the statement worked as intended.

IF
    a conditional decision statement used to control the flow of a program (see branching); the structure of an IF statement evaluates an expression (e.g. `hour < 12`) and performs a specified code block only if the condition is `true`; e.g.:
    
    ```
    IF hour < 12:

    the Internet of Things vision is for a world full of networked physical objects; the Internet of Things is concerned with equipping objects with internet accessible identification and data sharing capabilities; ideally, these objects are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, providing them with the ability to make sense of their local situation and interact within a given context.

iteration
    a repetition of a process or set of instructions in computer programming where each repeated cycle builds on a previous (see `REPEAT` statement); typically this uses a `FOR` loop command with a counter such as the example below to add the numbers from 1 to 9;

    ```
    FOR number = 1 to 9;
        sum = sum + number
    ```

    recursive; revisiting earlier parts of a process to further clarify meaning or refine ideas and solutions.

justified
    sound reasons or evidence are provided to support an argument, statement or conclusion.

keys
    unique identifiers in a relational database used to ensure that a record in a table can be uniquely identified by one or a combination of fields within a table; three common types are:
    - primary: a relational database has only one primary key; it is a unique identifier for each record used to help establish relationships with other tables, e.g. licence number, phone number, student ID
    - secondary: a table may have more than one choice for the primary key; only one is chosen as the primary key; those not chosen are known as secondary keys, e.g. if student ID is chosen as the primary key, other choices including licence number and phone number are secondary keys
    - foreign: a primary key from one table that appears as a field in another where the first table has a relationship to the second, e.g. if table A has a primary key X that linked to table B where X was a field in B, then X would be a foreign key in B.

logical

modularisation
    a concept used for reducing the complexity of a system; this system (e.g. IT application) is deconstructed into more or less independent units or modules; the modules should be able to exist independently from each other, but the system as a whole can only function as an integrated structure.

normal form
    a defined standard structure for relational databases; the forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for third normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for second normal form, and second normal form must adhere to those for first normal form; the first three normal forms are:
    - first normal form — the information is stored in a relational table, each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns
    - second normal form — the table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key
    - third normal form — the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

normalisation
    the process of ensuring that a database conforms to a set of normal forms. Its primary purpose is to remove redundancies that create threats to data integrity such as update anomalies. It also plays a role in making querying more efficient.

SELECT
    a statement in structured query language (SQL) that retrieves information from a database; the structure of a `SELECT` statement provides for optional clauses that allow for the filtering, grouping and sorting of data on retrieval; a simple `SELECT` statement may look like the following:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM People; 
    ```

    where the resulting set would be all of the records in the People table;

    following is an example of a more complicated `SELECT` statement:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM People WHERE gender="m";
    ```
    
    this uses the optional WHERE clause to retrieve only the males (that is, that have a gender of "m") from the database table.

selection
    a basic construct of an algorithm indicating the next instruction to be executed depends on a ‘condition’; a condition is defined for these purposes as a logical expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

    - designed abstract systems, e.g. mathematic equations, computer algorithms
    - human activity systems, e.g. a team task, flight crew, human–machine interface

systems thinking
    a holistic approach to the identification and solving of problems, where parts and components of a system, their interactions and interrelationships are analysed individually to see how they influence the functioning of the whole system; this approach enables students to understand systems and work with complexity, uncertainty and risk;

    systems thinking also involves understanding the interdependence between systems and how a change or output from one system can affect another, and how this affects larger systems such as the economy and society.

technical feasibility
    the process of proving that the concept is technically possible; the aim of a technical feasibility study is to confirm that the prototype or solution will perform as intended and to verify that there are no barriers in generating these; 
    
    it should communicate the technical aspects of the development process, e.g. algorithms, selection and justification of development tools, sketches and diagrams of the user interface, user experience and other requirements for development.
