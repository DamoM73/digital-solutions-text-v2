# Glossary

```{glossary}
abstraction
    A process of reducing complexity to formulate generalised fundamental ideas or concepts removed from specific details or situation, e.g. the idea that a cricket ball is a sphere in the same way that a soccer ball is, or the concept that data can be organised in records made up of fields irrespective of whether the data are numbers, text, images or something else; abstraction involves hiding details of an idea, problem or solution that are not relevant to focus on a manageable number of aspects.

accurate
    Precise and exact; to the point; consistent with or exactly conforming to a truth, standard, rule, model, convention or known facts; free from error or defect; meticulous; correct in all details.

adept
    Very/highly skilled or proficient at something; expert.

adequate
    Satisfactory or acceptable in quality or quantity equal to the requirement or occasion.

algorithm
    A step-by-step procedures required to solve a problem. An algorithm may be described in many ways; pseudocode is often useful in visualising an algorithm.

analyse
    Dissect to ascertain and examine constituent parts and/or their relationships; break down or examine in order to identify the essential elements, features, components or structure; determine the logic and reasonableness of information; examine or consider something in order to explain and interpret it, for the purpose of finding meaning or relationships and identifying patterns, similarities and differences.

annotated
    Made or furnished critical or explanatory notes, or comments to a picture, drawing, sketch or diagram.

app
    A software application with a very specific or narrow purpose designed to run on mobile devices (such as smartphones or tablets), through a web browser or on a personal computer; the feature set of an application is limited when compared with a full-featured desktop application for a similar purpose, e.g. a photoediting application has a smaller set of features than an industrystandard photographic suite.

appropriate
    Acceptable; suitable or fitting for a particular purpose, circumstance, context, etc.
    
aspect
    A particular part of a feature of something; a facet, phase or part of a whole.

assignment
    A basic construct of an algorithm used to store the value of an expression into a variable.

astute
    Showing an ability to accurately assess situations or people; of keen discernment.

audience
    An individual or group for whom the response is designed and delivered.

Australian Privacy Principles
    The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), which are contained in schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act), outline how most Australian and Norfolk Island Government agencies, all private sector and not-for-profit organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, all private health service providers and some small businesses (collectively called ‘APP entities’) must handle, use and manage personal information (Australian Government 2013).

binary
    Two states or permissible values to represent data, such as ON and OFF positions of a light switch or transistors in a computer silicon chip that can be in either the electrical state of ON or OFF; binary data are typically represented as a series of single digits referred to as binary digits (or bits) due to each taking on the value of either 0 or 1.

branching
    Making a decision between two or more actions depending on sets of conditions and the data provided, e.g. in testing whether a light works.

characteristics
    A set of distinguishing aspects (including attributes and behaviours) of an object, material, living thing, system or event; in Digital Solutions, e.g. the characteristics of a stored digital graphic may be the colour depth (maximum number of colours represented), the resolution (number of pixels per area, or height and width) and the compression used.

coding 
    Translating programming logic into code, i.e. the implementation of a solution using tools, techniques and best practices.

coherent
    Having a natural or due agreement of parts; connected; consistent; logical, orderly; well-structured and makes sense; rational, with parts that are harmonious; having an internally consistent relation of parts.

communicate
    Convey knowledge and/or understandings to others; make known; transmit.

competent
    Having suitable or sufficient skills, knowledge, experience, etc. for some purpose; adequate but not exceptional; capable; suitable or sufficient for the purpose; having the necessary ability, knowledge or skill to do something successfully; efficient and capable (of a person); acceptable and satisfactory, though not outstanding.

components
    Parts (made of two or more elements) that make up a whole object or system and perform specific functions, e.g. a digital solution usually includes three components: data, system/user interface and text-based source code that may be interpreted or compiled.
    
compression
    A process of encoding information using fewer bits, i.e. 0 or 1, than an original representation, to reduce file size, typically using mathematical formulas to remove repeated data, combine related data or simplify data, e.g. a line segment can be represented by the position of the end points instead of every dot on it.

computational thinking
    A problem-solving method that involves various techniques and strategies that can be implemented by digital systems; techniques and strategies may include organising data logically, breaking down problems into parts, defining abstract concepts, and designing and using algorithms, patterns and models.

condition
    A logical expression that evaluates to true or false; a pre-condition is a statement or set of statements that describes a condition or conditions that should be true when a specific operation is called; a post-condition is a statement or set of statements that describes a condition or conditions that should be true when the operation has completed its task.

considered
    Formed after careful and deliberate thought.

constraints
    Limitations or restrictions that must be considered and accommodated when defining a problem, e.g. teacher-specified limitations, available time, physical realities, legalities.

content
    The things that are held or included in something, includes context,concepts, principles, processes, purpose and scenarios.

context
    The circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.

control systems
    A device or set of devices to manage, command, direct or regulate the behaviour of other devices or systems; a mechanical, optical or electronic system that is used to maintain a desired output.

criteria
    Characteristics by which something is evaluated or appraised; the teacher or client (prescribed) or students (self-determined) develop criteria, e.g. specific needs, identified purpose, impacts quality or effectiveness of solution.

critical
    Involving skilful judgment as to truth, merit, etc.; involving the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment; expressing or involving an analysis of the merits and faults of a work of literature, music, or art; incorporating a detailed and scholarly analysis and commentary (of a text); rationally appraising for logical consistency and merit.

data
    In Digital Solutions, discrete representation of information using number codes; data may include characters (e.g. alphabetic letters, numbers and symbols), images, sounds and/or instructions that, when represented by number codes, can be manipulated, stored and communicated by digital systems, e.g. characters may be represented using ASCII code or images may be represented by a bitmap of numbers representing each ‘dot’ or pixel.

database
    A collection of data organised by records and fields that can be easily stored, accessed, managed and updated; each discrete piece of data to be stored is represented by a field (e.g. song title, song artist or bank account number, date of transaction) and values in the fields that are associated with an entity (e.g. a song, a bank transaction) are a record; interaction with a database usually takes place through a user interface designed specifically for the structure and use of the stored data

data collection
    Describes the numerical, categorical and textual facts measured, collected, e.g. from data loggers or harvested from local councils, Australian Bureau of Statistics or other websites, or calculated as the basis for creating information and its binary representation in digital systems.

data flow diagrams
    Visual representations describing the flow of data through a system 
    
data validation
    In computer science, ensuring that data inserted into an application satisfies defined formats and other input criteria.

decomposition
    To separate a complex problem into parts to allow a problem to be more easily understood, e.g. to create an interactive story, one can decompose the problem to a list of characters and their characteristics (e.g. clothing), the actions of the characters, the backdrops and the sequence of scenes with reference to which characters, actions and backdrops are involved in each scene; decomposition may be represented in diagrams.

deconstructing
    A process of dismantling or pulling apart a product or system to systematically identify and analyse components and their relationships.

describe
    Give an account (written or spoken) of a situation, event, pattern or process, or of the characteristics or features of something.

design thinking
    Use of strategies for understanding design problems, visualising and generating creative ideas, and analysing and evaluating those ideas that best meet the criteria for success; students use both convergent and divergent thinking skills; divergent thinking supports creativity and the generation of a range of ideas, and convergent thinking supports the selection and generation of a preferred solution

desk checking
    A method used by a human to check the logic of a computer program’s algorithm to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring; this may be done on paper, using a diagram or mentally trying a sample of typical inputs to see what the outputs would be; e.g. to desk check a branching statement {IF age >65 THEN ‘retire’ ELSE ‘keep working’}, the values for age of 64, 65 and 66 could be tried to show that 64 and 65 would result in ‘keep working’ and 66 in ‘retire’ so that it could be decided if the statement worked as intended.

determine
    Establish, conclude or ascertain after consideration, observation, investigation or calculation; decide or come to a resolution.

develop
    Elaborate, expand or enlarge in detail; add detail and fullness to; cause to become more complex or intricate

digital technologies
    any technology controlled using digital instructions, including computer hardware and software, digital media and media devices, digital toys and accessories, and contemporary and emerging communication technologies; these technologies are based on instructions given, using binary (0 or 1) code, that invariably mean one or more processors are present to respond to these instructions; computers, smartphones, digital cameras, printers and robots are all examples of digital technologies

discerning
    discriminating; showing intellectual perception; showing good judgment; making thoughtful and astute choices; selected for value or relevance

discriminating
    differentiating; distinctive; perceiving differences or distinctions with nicety; possessing discrimination; perceptive and judicious; making judgments about quality; having or showing refined taste or good judgment
