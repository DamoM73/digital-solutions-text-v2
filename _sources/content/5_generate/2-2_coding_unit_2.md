# Coding &mdash; Unit 2

## SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data within a database, as well as to define and manage database structures. SQL is used to perform tasks such as querying data to retrieve specific information, inserting new data records, updating existing data, and deleting unwanted data. Additionally, SQL enables the creation of database schemas, the definition of relationships between different data tables, and the implementation of security measures to control access to the data. Its powerful and versatile nature makes SQL an essential tool for database management and analysis.

According to Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer Survey {cite}`stackoverflow_2023_stack`, SQL-based databases dominate the database management system (DBMS) market. It is estimated that approximately 90% or more of databases use SQL.

### Database Resources

For the following SQL section we will be using the following databases:

- [Chinook database](./assets/chinook.db)
- [Movies database](./assets/moives.db)
- [Repairs database](./assets/repairs.db)
- [School database](./assets/school.db)
- [Shares database](./assets/shares.db)
- [World database](./assets/world.db)

Below is the Relational Schemas for these databases

[Exercise solutions](../8_solutions/1_sql_exercises.md) can be found in the solutions section.

### SELECT Statement

The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve specific data from tables within a relational database. The data is return in the form of a table.

### Filters and Aggregators

SQL filter clauses are used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query based on specified conditions, enabling more precise data retrieval and manipulation. While SQL aggregators are functions used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a table's column and return a single value.

### GROUP BY and HAVING

The SQL `GROUP BY` statement is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often in conjunction with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group. While the SQL HAVING statement is used to filter groups of rows created by the `GROUP BY` clause based on specified conditions, typically involving aggregate functions.

#### GROUP BY and HAVING Tutorials

### Subqueries

SQL sub-queries are queries embedded within another SQL query to provide results that are used by the outer query, enabling more complex and flexible data retrieval and manipulationâ€‹. Subqueries are possible since every query returns a table. Effectively, you run one query which returns a table, then you run another query on the data in the returned table.

## Python and SQLite

This section gives a brief overview of using SQLite in Python. W3schools give more details in **[this blog](https://www.w3schools.blog/sqlite-tutorial)**.

To work with SQLite in Python we will use the `sqlite3` module. It is part of the Python standard Library, so it is already installed.

### Setup

There are three steps to setting up your Python code to use `sqlite3`:

#### 1. Import the module

This is your usual `import` command at the top of your Python file.

``` python
import sqlite3
```

#### 2. Connect to the database

You need to create a connection object. The connection object is used to make changes to the database file. Generate a connection object using the `sqlite3.connect` method and assign it to a variable.

``` python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("database_file.db")
```

#### 3. Create a cursor

Finally you need to create a cursor object. The cursor object is used to run SQL queries on the database via the connection object.

``` python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("database_file.db")
cursor = connection.cursor()
```

Now you are set to access your SQLite database with Python.

### SQLite3 Queries

There are two steps to running a query in using `sqlite3` and Python.

#### 1. Execute the SQL query statement

The SQL query statement is provided as a string. Below is an example of how I format the code using a multiline string. It makes it easier to read, and, therefore, increases maintainability.

``` python
cursor.execute(
    """
    SELECT name, phone_num
    FROM customers
    """
)
```

#### 2. Fetch the results

Once the query has been executed, you need to fetch the results that are stored in the cursor. You have three fetching options:

1. `fetchall()` - returns all the results
2. `fetchone()` - returns the next result
3. `fetchmany(size)` - returns the `size` number of rows

``` python
cursor.execute(
    """
    SELECT name, phone_num
    FROM Customers
    """
)

reults = cursor.fetchall()
```

### SQLite3 INSERT, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE

All SQL statements that involve making changes to the database (INSERT, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE) also have two steps, but they are slightly different.

#### Execute the SQL statement

The first step in as the same. The cursor needs to be used to execute the SQL statement.

``` python
import sqlite3

cursor.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO Customers (name, phone_num)
    VALUES ("John", "0434123456")
    """
)
```

#### Commit changes

The changes to the database will not be permanent until they have been committed to the database file. You can commit numerous execute commands to the database in one go. To make the commitment we use the connection's `commit()` method.

``` python
import sqlite3

cursor.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO Customers (name, phone_num)
    VALUES ("John", "0434123456")
    """
)

connection.commit()
```

### Using variables

![XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png)

To avoid SQL injection attacks, the correct way to insert variables values into your SQL statements is to use the parameter substitution method. This method inserts a placeholder in the SQL statement, and the values are then passes as a second argument to the `execute()` method. We will be using dictionaries to do this, although lists can also be used.

#### Parameterised Queries

Below is an example of a parameterised query statement.

``` python
import sqlite3

cursor.execute(
    """
    SELECT name, phone_num
    FROM Customers
    WHERE name = :name
    """,
    {
        "name": "John"
    }
)

reults = cursor.fetchall()
```

#### Parameterised INSERT, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE

Below is an example of a parameterised insert statement

``` python
import sqlite3

cursor.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO Customers (name, phone_num)
    VALUES (:name, :phone)
    """,
    {
        "name":"John",
        "phone":"0434123456"
    }
)

connection.commit()
```

## Converting datastore to a database

One of the advantages of using MVC Architecture is ease of refactoring. You can change any of the three modules, as long as calling the methods that interconnect the modules remain the same. For example, if you want to change the datastore module so it uses a database, you can change that one module and leave the main and UI module alone.

The videos below build on our **[hangman game from Unit 1](2-1_coding_unit_1.md)** by changing the datastore to an SQLite database. The use of a database allows for other features like recording results and having multiple user, so the other two modules are adjusted to include these features. These video also provide an example of a **<a href="https://youtu.be/Vq1laKeSk9M?si=Jj15sQKSG8DpizUp" target="_blank">stacked widget</a>**.
