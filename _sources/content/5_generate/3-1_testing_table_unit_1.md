# Testing Table &mdash; Unit 1

You should be consistently testing your code as you develop it. The more frequently you test the easier it will be to resolve problems.

In Unit 1, you will focus on Unit Testing.

Unit testing is important. Each time you complete a method you should test it. This might require your creating a separate testing program, that imports the class, and then tests the method. Other time it might require you adding a `print` statement to display output to terminal. Whatever method you use, the objective is to simulate the method being using as part of the program.

To test you should have a series of input values and their expected output values. Run the method entering each input value. Then check output against what was expected. If the output is incorrect, then there is an error in the method. Fix the error, then test again.

Use the Unit Testing table to record this process.
