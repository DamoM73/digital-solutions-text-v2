# Coding

In coding you will be taking the algorithms from the develop phase and converting them into Python code.

You will need to develop your UI using [](qt_designer). This will be saved to a `.ui` file which you will have to convert to Python script using the command.

```
pyuic6 your_file_name.ui -o your_file_name.py
```
