# IPO Tables &mdash; Unit 4



```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- Generate a well-ordered and unambiguous algorithm to solve defined problems using pseudocode
- Recognise and describe how simple algorithms consist of input, process and output at various stages
- Symbolise and explain the basic constructs of an algorithm, including assignment, sequence, selection, condition, iteration and modularisation
- Symbolise representations of a digital solution
- Symbolise algorithmic steps as pseudocode
- Develop simple Caesar, Polyaphabetic (e.g. Vignere and Gronsfeld), and one-time pad encryption algorithms
