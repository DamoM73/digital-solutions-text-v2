# IPO Tables &mdash; Unit 3



```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- Generate a conceptual model of a possible solution by applying systems thinking that identifies system boundaries, properties, inputs and outputs, user interface, system controls
- Recognise and describe program components such as objects, event handlers and multimedia assets
- Recognise and describe external data stores such as file structures or object libraries
- Recognise and describe internal data structures such as arrays, lists and dictionaries
- Generate ideas using innovation and collaboration
- Recognise and use the basic constructs of an algorithm including assignment, sequence, selection, condition, iteration and modularisation
- Recognise and use appropriate pseudocode conventions
- Understand that simple algorithms consist of input, process and output
- Symbolise well-ordered and unambiguous algorithms using pseudocode for procedural code that processes data for insertion into a database or manipulates or displays retrieved data
- Symbolise well-ordered and unambiguous algorithms using pseudocode for user interaction, data validation and data presentation
- Generate generic pseudocode suitable for a variety of programming languages to communicate requirements for programmed components
- Generate pseudocode to solve defined problems
