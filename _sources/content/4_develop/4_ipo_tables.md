# IPO Tables

IPO tables are used to develop your algorithms. They are made up of three columns:

- **Inputs:** Lists all the information/actions this section needs.
- **Process:** Contains the **[pseudocode](../2_concepts/2-4_pseudocode.md)** for this algorithm, following QCAA pseudocode rules
- **Output:** Lists all the information/actions that result from this section.

Each IPO Table should represent one method (functions) with the **[Use Case Diagram](../3_explore/4_use_case_diagram.md)** informing what those methods should be. There is no need to represent all of your methods in IPO tables, but rather you need to show the more complicated or tricky code.

## Coverage

Across all you IPO Tables you should have examples of all the following algorithm components:

- sequence
- assignment
- condition
- selection
- iteration
- modularisation
