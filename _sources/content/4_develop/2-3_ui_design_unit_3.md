## Wireframe


## Mock-up


```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- Refine ideas for components of a prototype digital solution
- Generate low-fidelity user-interface prototypes appropriate to the digital context by using the elements and principles of visual communication such as sketches, mood boards, storyboards, sitemaps, wireframes and mock-ups
- Generate a conceptual model of a possible solution by applying systems thinking that identifies system boundaries, properties, inputs and outputs, user interface, system controls
- Symbolise and explain useability principles, including accessibility, effectiveness, safety, utility and learnability 
- Symbolise and explain a variety of interfaces
- Explore and use the elements and principles of visual communication elements are limited to space, line, colour, shape, texture, tone, form, proportion and scale
- Explore and use the elements and principles of visual communication principles are limited to balance, contrast, proximity, harmony, alignment, repetition and hierarchy
