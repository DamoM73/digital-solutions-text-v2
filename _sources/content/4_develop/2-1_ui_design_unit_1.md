# UI Design &mdash; Unit 1

In Unit 1 your UI Design should focus on applying the **[Useability Principles](../2_concepts/3-1_useability_principles.md)**.

Systematically apply each of the principles to your design:

1. Create your initial design
2. Consider your designs **[](accessibility)** then adjust it.
3. Consider your designs **[](effectiveness)** then adjust it.
4. Consider your designs **[](learnability)** then adjust it.
5. Consider your designs **[](safety)** then adjust it.
6. Consider your designs **[](utility)** then adjust it.

Ensure that you annotate your design decisions to demonstrate where you applied the Useability Principles.
