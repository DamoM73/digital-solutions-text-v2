# Data Requirements

In assessing the data needs and requirements you need to list all the data that the application will use. Most of these have already been identified in the Explore phase and are present in the mind map.

You will need to consider:

- Any data that has been provided
- Any data that the application will collect through its operation. This includes:
  - data explicitly mentioned by the client or the technical proposal
  - data you have determined is needed
