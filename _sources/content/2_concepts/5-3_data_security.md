# Data Security

> Data has never been more valuable. It is an increasingly important driver of growth in our modern economy. Whether it is data about individuals, businesses or government, data underpins how we communicate, conduct business, and receive services. At the same time it can be stolen, manipulated or used as a weapon by foreign adversaries and criminals {cite}`departmentofhomeaffairs_2023_data`.

Data security is crucial because it safeguards sensitive information from unauthorized access, ensuring that personal, financial, and confidential data remains private and protected. In today's digital age, where vast amounts of data are shared and stored online, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks is significant. These breaches can result in identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.

Data breachers far more common than most people believe. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, publishes regular **<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/notifiable-data-breaches-publications" target="_blank">reports on breaches involving Australian organisations**</a>. Check the latest report to see the extent of data breaching occurring. Note that these are only the breaches that Australian Law requires organisations to report.

Data security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, help prevent such incidents and ensure that individuals and organizations can trust that their data is safe and confidential. It's not only about protecting information but also about maintaining trust, compliance with regulations, and upholding the integrity of data in an increasingly interconnected world.

## Why is encryption necessary

Data encryption is necessary for several important reasons:

1. **Data Security**: Encryption helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if someone gains access to the data, they won't be able to read or use it without the encryption key.

2. **Privacy**: In an era of digital communication, maintaining personal privacy is crucial. Encryption ensures that your personal messages, emails, and data remain private and can't be easily intercepted or eavesdropped upon.

3. **Compliance**: Many regulations and laws require organizations to protect sensitive data, such as personal or financial information. Encryption helps companies meet these compliance requirements and avoid legal issues.

4. **Data Integrity**: Encryption not only secures data from unauthorized access but also ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with during transmission or storage. If encrypted data is altered, it becomes unreadable.

5. **Protection Against Data Breaches**: In the event of a data breach, encrypted data is significantly more challenging for attackers to use. Even if they gain access to encrypted data, it's useless without the encryption key.

6. **Secure Communication**: Encryption is essential for securing online transactions, such as e-commerce purchases and online banking. It prevents hackers from intercepting sensitive financial information.

7. **International Data Transfer**: When data is transferred across borders, encryption can protect it from government surveillance or other forms of unauthorized access.

In summary, data encryption is necessary to safeguard sensitive information, maintain privacy, comply with regulations, ensure data integrity, protect against data breaches, enable secure communication, and secure data during international transfers. It's a fundamental tool in the realm of cybersecurity and data protection.

## Types of encryption
