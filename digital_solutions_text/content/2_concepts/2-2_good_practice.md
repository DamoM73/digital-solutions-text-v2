# Good Practice

The are many good practices to following when programming. These need to be applied right from when the algorithms are first being developed.

## Dependability

In systems engineering, dependability is a measure of a system's reliability, maintainability.

- **maintainability:** easy-to-read code that is easy to dissect, so that parts relating to a required change are easy to modify without risking a chain reaction of errors in dependant modules.
- **reliability:** the probability of a program producing an error or failing to process a task;
  - In Digital Solutions, testing and useability considerations contribute to reliability.
  - For example, predicting where errors are likely to occur (whether user or systems related) can inform mindful use programming constructs.

## Efficiency

A situation in which a system or machine uses minimal resources such as time and processing power while still achieving its goals; there are two types of efficiency:

- **algorithmic efficiency:** refers to the reliability, speed and programming methodology for developing succinct structures within an application
- **code efficiency:** is directly linked with algorithmic efficiency and the speed of runtime execution for software, and is the key element in ensuring high performance; its goal is to reduce resource consumption and completion time as much as possible with minimum risk to the business or operating environment, e.g. using a FOR loop instead of repetitive IF, THEN and ELSE statements where appropriate.

## Effectiveness

A measure of the success of the algorithm to solve an identified problem; depending on the complexity of the problem, this could be tested with a desk check, but generally, the effectiveness of an algorithm can only be determined after the code has been generated and then tested within the appropriate context;
