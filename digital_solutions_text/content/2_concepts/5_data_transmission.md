# Data Exchange

Digital solutions are increasingly required to exchange data securely and efficiently. In this section we will investigate elements of cybersecurity by exploring the conditions, environment and methods for enabling data to flow between different digital systems.

We will analyse data privacy and data integrity risks associated with transferring data between applications. We will also evaluate the personal, social and economic impacts associated with the use and availability of both public and private data.

This focus will be broken into three part:

- Privacy
- Networking
- Data security
