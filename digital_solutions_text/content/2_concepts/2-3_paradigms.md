# Programming Paradigms

## Object Orientated Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes and models software as a collection of objects, each representing a real-world entity or concept. In OOP, an **object** is an **instance** of a **class**, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. Objects can have **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions) that define their behaviour.

The four main principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object and exposes only the necessary functionalities through methods. It helps in data protection and abstraction.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows for flexibility and dynamic method invocation.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It simplifies complex systems by modelling them at a higher level.

OOP promotes the organization of code into modular, reusable, and maintainable components, making it a widely used programming paradigm in software development.

Python is one of the leading OOP languages currently in use.

## Event Driven Programming

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm where the flow of a computer program is determined by events, which can be user actions (like clicking a button), sensor inputs, or messages from other parts of the program. In event-driven programming, the program responds to these events by executing specific code (event handlers) associated with each event. 

Key concepts in event-driven programming include:

1. **Events:** Events are occurrences that trigger the execution of code. They can be generated by user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard presses), system notifications (e.g., a file is downloaded), or timers.

2. **Event Handlers:** Event handlers are functions or methods that are executed in response to specific events. They define what happens when an event occurs.

3. **Event Loop:** An event loop is a central part of event-driven programs. It continuously listens for events and dispatches them to the appropriate event handlers.

Event-driven programming is commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), web development (e.g., handling user interactions on a web page), game development, and many other applications where the program's behavior needs to respond to various external stimuli. Popular programming languages for event-driven programming include JavaScript (for web development), Python (with libraries like Tkinter for GUIs), and languages that support event-driven frameworks like C# with Windows Forms.
