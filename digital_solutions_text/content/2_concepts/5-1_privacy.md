# Privacy

Data privacy, also known as information privacy or data protection, refers to the protection of an individual's or organization's sensitive and personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It involves ensuring that data is handled in a way that respects the privacy rights of individuals, maintaining the confidentiality and security of the data. 

Data privacy encompasses various practices, policies, and measures aimed at safeguarding data from breaches, cyberattacks, or misuse. It is a fundamental aspect of maintaining trust, ethical data handling, and complying with data protection laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the Australian Privacy Principles.

Data privacy is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Personal Security:** Protecting personal information, such as your name, address, and financial details, helps prevent identity theft and fraud. Unauthorized access to this data can lead to financial losses and even legal issues.

2. **Digital Footprint:** In today's digital age, our online activities create a digital footprint. Data privacy ensures that your online behaviour, preferences, and interactions remain private, reducing the risk of personal information being exploited for targeted ads or cyberattacks.

3. **Trust:** Individuals and organizations must trust that their data is handled responsibly. Maintaining data privacy fosters trust between individuals and the companies or platforms they interact with.

4. **Compliance:** Many countries have data protection laws that require organizations to follow specific guidelines when handling personal data. Ensuring data privacy helps organizations stay compliant with these laws, avoiding legal consequences.

5. **Ethical Considerations:** Respecting data privacy is an ethical obligation. It's about treating individuals with dignity and respecting their right to control their personal information.

6. **Reputation:** Organizations that mishandle data can suffer reputational damage. Customers and users are more likely to trust and support companies that prioritize data privacy.

In Australia data privacy is governed by the Australian Privacy Principles.

## The Australian Privacy Principles

> The Australian Privacy Principles (or APPs) are the cornerstone of the privacy protection framework in the Privacy Act 1988. They apply to any organisation or agency the Privacy Act covers {cite}`oaic_2023_australian`.

There are 13 Australian Privacy Principles and they govern standards, rights and obligations around:

- the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
- an organisation or agencyâ€™s governance and accountability
- integrity and correction of personal information
- the rights of individuals to access their personal information.

### APP 1 - Open and Transparent Management

Organizations must have clear and transparent policies on how they manage personal information.

Key elements of APP 1 include:

- **Privacy Policies**: Organizations are required to have clear and easily accessible privacy policies that outline their practices for handling personal information. These policies should explain what kind of information is collected, why it's collected, how it's used, and who it may be disclosed to.
- **Access to Privacy Policies**: Privacy policies must be made available to individuals free of charge and in an easily understandable format. This can be done through a website, in printed form, or by other means, depending on how the organization interacts with individuals.
- **Purpose of Collection**: When personal information is collected, organizations should inform individuals of the primary purpose for which the information is being collected. This helps individuals understand why their data is needed.
- **Cross-Referencing Privacy Policies**: If an organization collects personal information from another organization, they should ensure that individuals are aware of both organizations' privacy policies.
- **Changes to Policies**: If an organization changes its privacy policy, individuals should be notified of the changes and given the opportunity to opt out if they disagree with the new policy.
- **Contact Information**: Privacy policies should include contact information for the organization or agency's Privacy Officer, making it easy for individuals to ask questions or raise concerns about their personal information.

### APP 2 - Anonymity and Pseudonymity

Individuals have the option to interact with organizations anonymously or using a pseudonym, where practical.

Key elements of APP 2 include:

- **Option for Anonymity**: Under APP 2, organizations and agencies should give individuals the option to interact with them without having to identify themselves, unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. This means that individuals should have the choice to remain anonymous when using services or accessing information, if it's feasible for the organization.
- **Use of Pseudonyms**: Individuals should also be given the option to use a pseudonym or alias instead of their real name when dealing with organizations. This allows for a level of privacy while still engaging in transactions or interactions.
- **Reasonable and Impracticable Exceptions**: There are situations where it may be unreasonable or impracticable to allow anonymity or pseudonymity. For example, if a financial institution needs to verify a customer's identity for legal or security reasons, it would be impracticable to allow anonymity. However, such exceptions must be justifiable.
- **Collection of Minimal Information**: When organizations do collect personal information, they should limit it to what is necessary for the purpose of the interaction. This discourages the unnecessary collection of data.
- **Exceptions**: There are exceptions to APP 2, such as when a law or court order requires the collection of specific identifying information.

### APP 3 - Collection of Solicited Personal Information

Organizations can only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for their functions and activities.

Key elements of APP 3 include:

- **Open and Transparent Collection**: Organizations must be open and transparent about the collection of personal information. This means individuals should be informed about why their information is being collected, what it will be used for, and who it may be disclosed to.
- **Collection for a Lawful Purpose**: Personal information should only be collected for a lawful purpose that is directly related to the functions or activities of the organization. It should not be collected for unrelated purposes.
- **Direct Collection**: Whenever possible, organizations should collect personal information directly from the individual it relates to. For example, if an organization needs information from a customer, it should seek that information directly from the customer.
- **Exceptions**: There are exceptions that allow for the collection of personal information without the individual's consent in certain circumstances. These exceptions include situations where collection is required or authorized by law, or when it is necessary to deal with a serious threat to health or safety.
- **Sensitive Information**: If an organization needs to collect sensitive information (such as health information or racial or ethnic origin), stricter requirements apply. Sensitive information can generally only be collected with the individual's consent, or if required or authorized by law.
- **Notification**: Individuals must be notified of the organization's privacy policy, which should include information about how personal information is handled, the purposes for which it is collected, and how individuals can access and correct their information.

### APP 4 - Dealing with Unsolicited Personal Information

When an organization receives unsolicited personal information, they must determine if they could have collected it under the usual circumstances.

Key elements of APP 4 include:

- **Reasonable Steps**: When an organization receives unsolicited personal information, it must assess whether it could have collected the information under APP 3 if it had solicited the information. If the organization determines that it could have collected the information under APP 3, it should treat it as if it had been solicited.
- **Sensitive Information**: Special care should be taken when dealing with unsolicited sensitive information (such as health information or information about an individual's racial or ethnic origin). The organization must ensure that this information is not used or disclosed unless one of the exceptions under APP 3 applies.
- **Destruction or De-identification**: If the organization determines that it could not have collected the unsolicited personal information under APP 3 and it is not otherwise required or authorized by law to retain the information, it must take reasonable steps to destroy the information or ensure it is de-identified.
- **Notification**: Individuals should be notified if an organization receives unsolicited personal information about them, unless it would be unreasonable or impractical to do so. This notification should inform individuals about how the organization will handle the information.

### APP 5 - Notification of Collection

Individuals must be informed when their personal information is collected, including the purpose of collection.

Key elements of APP 5 include:

- **Openness and Transparency**: Organizations are required to have a clearly expressed and up-to-date privacy policy that outlines their practices for managing personal information. This policy should be readily available and easily accessible to individuals.
- **Notifying Individuals**: When an organization collects personal information directly from an individual, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of the following:
  - The identity of the organization and how to contact it.
  - The fact that the individual can access their personal information and seek correction if necessary.
  - The purposes for which the information is being collected.
  - Any third parties or types of third parties to whom the information might be disclosed.
  - Any legal requirements or consequences if the information is not provided.
- **Exceptions**: There are certain exceptions to the notification requirement. For example, notification may not be necessary if the individual is already aware of the information being collected, or if it is impractical to provide such notification.
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Non-compliance with APP 5 can have significant consequences, as it goes to the heart of privacy transparency and fairness. Individuals have the right to be informed about how their information is being handled.

### APP 6 - Use or Disclosure

Personal information can only be used or disclosed for the purpose it was collected, unless the individual consents or an exception applies.

Key elements of APP 6 include:

- **Primary Purpose**: Personal information can generally only be used or disclosed for the primary purpose for which it was collected, unless an exception applies.
- **Secondary Purpose**: If an organization wishes to use or disclose personal information for a secondary purpose (a purpose other than the primary one), it must obtain the individual's consent unless another exception applies.
- **Exceptions**: There are several exceptions under APP 6 that allow for the use or disclosure of personal information without the need for consent. Some of these exceptions include when the use or disclosure is:
  - Required or authorized by law.
  - Necessary to prevent a threat to life, health, or safety.
  - Reasonably necessary for law enforcement purposes.
  - Related to research, and steps are taken to ensure the information remains de-identified.
- **Direct Marketing**: If personal information is collected for the purpose of direct marketing, the organization must provide a clear and easy way for individuals to opt-out of receiving direct marketing communications.
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Non-compliance with APP 6 can result in a breach of an individual's privacy rights. It's essential for organizations to ensure that any use or disclosure of personal information aligns with the principles outlined in APP 6.

### APP 7 - Direct Marketing

Individuals have the right to opt out of receiving direct marketing materials.

Key elements of APP 7 include:

- **Consent**: Before organizations can engage in direct marketing activities, they must obtain the individual's consent. Consent should be informed, voluntary, and easy to withdraw. Individuals should have a clear and simple way to opt-out of further direct marketing communications.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Organizations must provide a straightforward opt-out mechanism in their marketing materials. This allows individuals to indicate that they do not wish to receive further direct marketing communications. Once an opt-out request is received, organizations must promptly comply with it.
- **Third-Party Marketing**: If organizations disclose personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes, they should inform individuals of this practice and provide them with an option to opt-out. This ensures transparency and gives individuals control over how their information is used.
- **Compliance with Spam Laws**: Organizations conducting electronic direct marketing (e.g., email marketing) must also comply with relevant spam laws, in addition to APP 7. These laws may impose additional requirements, such as including an unsubscribe link in marketing emails.
- **Exceptions**: There are some exceptions to the consent requirement for direct marketing. For example, organizations can send direct marketing communications without consent if they have obtained the individual's information through a conspicuous publication or if the communication is related to their ongoing relationship with the individual.

### APP 8 - Cross-Border Disclosure of Personal Information

Organizations must ensure that personal information sent overseas is protected by similar privacy laws.

Key elements of APP 8 include:

- **Consent and Notification**: Before an organization can transfer personal information outside of Australia, it generally requires the individual's consent. Individuals must be informed that their information will be sent overseas and the countries to which it will be sent.
- **Alternative Exceptions**: APP 8 provides some alternative exceptions to the consent requirement. These include situations where the overseas recipient is subject to similar privacy laws or binding contractual obligations that provide the same level of protection as the Australian Privacy Principles.
- **Notification of Countries**: Organizations must specify the countries, or at least the regions, where they intend to transfer personal information. This helps individuals understand the potential risks associated with cross-border data transfers.
- **Overseas Entities' Privacy Practices**: Organizations should take reasonable steps to ensure that overseas entities that receive personal information comply with privacy laws equivalent to the Australian Privacy Principles or are bound by contractual agreements to protect the information.
- **Complaint Handling**: APP 8 emphasizes the importance of having processes in place to handle complaints related to cross-border disclosure of personal information. Individuals should be able to lodge complaints if they believe their information is mishandled overseas.
- **Access and Correction**: Individuals should have avenues to access and correct their personal information held by overseas recipients. This means they can request access to their data and seek corrections if necessary, even if it's stored overseas.
- **Accountability**: Organizations are ultimately accountable for the security and privacy of personal information transferred overseas. They should take reasonable steps to ensure that overseas recipients comply with the Australian Privacy Principles.

### APP 9 - Adoption, Use, or Disclosure of Government-Related Identifiers

Organizations can only use government-related identifiers in specific circumstances.

Key elements of APP 9 include:

- **Limited Adoption**: APP 9 states that organizations should not adopt government-related identifiers as their own identifier unless it's required by law or is necessary for the organization's functions. In most cases, organizations should use their own identifiers for individuals.\
- **Limited Use and Disclosure**: Organizations can only use or disclose government-related identifiers for purposes permitted by law or if it's reasonably necessary for their functions. This means they should not use these identifiers for purposes unrelated to their core functions.
- **Exceptions**: APP 9 provides exceptions where the use or disclosure of government-related identifiers is allowed. This includes situations where it's required by law or authorized by a court or tribunal. It also permits the use or disclosure of such identifiers for identity verification.
- **Protection and Security**: Organizations must take steps to protect government-related identifiers from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This includes implementing security measures and access controls to prevent misuse.
- **Data Minimization**: APP 9 encourages organizations to collect only the government-related identifiers that are necessary for their functions. Unnecessary collection of these identifiers should be avoided.
- **Data Retention**: Organizations should not keep government-related identifiers for longer than necessary. Once the purpose for which they were collected has been fulfilled, they should be securely destroyed or de-identified.
- **Individual Access**: Individuals should have the right to access their government-related identifiers held by an organization. They can also request corrections if the information is inaccurate.
- **Complaints**: APP 9 requires organizations to have processes in place for handling complaints related to government-related identifiers. Individuals should be able to raise concerns about how their identifiers are being used or protected.

### APP 10 - Quality of Personal Information
