# Mind Map

## What is a mind map?

> A Mind Map is an easy way to brainstorm thoughts organically without worrying about order and structure. It allows you to visually structure your ideas to help with analysis and recall {cite}`mindmapping_2022_what`.

The flexibility of mind maps has seen them adopted by industry, education, government, NGOs, the arts and more. They are used for diverse purposes including brain storming, note-taking, and structing content. They're a useful method of externalising your thoughts, depicting the idea along with its connections to other ideas.

## How are we using mind maps?

In Digital Solutions we will be using mind maps for a very specific purpose. It will be our starting point for every project. Each Digital Solutions project will have a wide range of issues that you will need to consider. The mind map will represent your consideration of these issues.

The nodes in the mind map **should not be detailed**. They should represent the issues that you will address in detail during the rest of the project. In this wat, it forms a to do list for you project.

Since the EDGE process is not completely linear, you will continue to add to the mind map as your project progresses. Each time you think of a new issue that you need to resolve, add it to your mind map. This will act as a reminder to complete the task, as well as demonstrate your thinking throughout the process.

## Using XMind

We will be using [XMind](xmind_install) to create our mind maps. If you are familiar with other software, you are welcome to use it, but all examples and instructions will relate to XMind.

### Terminology

The names of the various nodes are taken from a family structure. Refer to the image below:

- **Parent Node** &mdash; nodes that have other node spawning off them
- **Child Node** &mdash; nodes that spawn off other (parent) nodes
  - Note: it is possible for a node to be both a parent and a child node. This is the same as real life where a parent is a parent to their child, as well as a child to their parent.
- **Sibling Nodes** &mdash; nodes that spawn from the same parent node
- **Active Node** &mdash; the currently editable node

### Editing Nodes

XMind always starts with a Central Topic node with four Main Idea (child) nodes.

To edit the content of a node, simply click on that node and type. Use the Enter key to save the change

### Adding new nodes

The addition of new nodes is in relation to the active node.

You can use the XMind toolbar of keyboard shortcuts to add Topics and Subtopics.

- **Topic** &mdash; (`enter` key) will add a topic as a sibling to the active topic.
- **Subtopic** &mdash; (`tab` key) will add a topic as a child to the active topic.
