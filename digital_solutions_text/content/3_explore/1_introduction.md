# Explore Phase

## What happens in the Explore Phase?

> The explore phase involves students investigating a need, want or opportunity to analyse and understand a digital problem and its relationship to existing solutions {cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`

The first step in solving a problem, in having a clear understanding of the problem. This is vital to ensure that the solution solves the actual problem, rather than a different problem. While the client may be able to express their needs or wants, they will not have the technical knowledge to address all the necessary details.

This is you first task. Get a clear understanding of the problem, identify all the technical details and clarify any ambiguities with the client. You should end up with a clear set of requirements that you solution **must** meet to be successful.

In real life, problems may be presented in the form of a request from someone or may be a personal problem. In industry, problems should be presented in a technical proposal. In either case, you will have a person with whom you can discus the problem and get all the details you need.

In our projects you will be provided with a either a task description or technical proposal. The teacher will act as proxy for the client, answering questions about problem.

To complete the Explore phase of the EDGE problem solving processes we will work through seven steps.

1. Describe the problem
2. Determine human needs or wants
3. Analyse the problem
4. Select impacts
5. Identify constraints
6. Identify requirements
7. Determine criteria
