# Use Case Diagram

> In the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a use case diagram can summarize the details of your system's users (also known as actors) and their interactions with the system. To build one, you'll use a set of specialized symbols and connectors. {cite}`lucidchart_2019_uml`
 
An effective use case diagram can help you represent:

- Scenarios in which your system or application interacts with people, organizations, or external systems
- Goals that your system or application helps those entities (known as actors) achieve
- The scope of your system

We will employ Use Case Diagrams to further develop our exploration of the problem.
