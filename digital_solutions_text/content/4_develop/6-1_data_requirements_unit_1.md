# Data Requirements &rarr; Unit 1

Databases are not introduced until Unit 2, so the data requirements for Unit 1 are limited.

## What data?

First you need to identify the data that the application will need. 

This data can be:

- Data that is provided
- Data that the application will collect

## What type of data?

Once you have identified what data the application will use, you then need to identify what type of data each one is.

There are two considerations when doing this:

- What is data types:
  - String
  - Integer
  - Float
  - Boolean
- What data structures:
  - lists
  - dictionaries
  - tuples
  - sets
