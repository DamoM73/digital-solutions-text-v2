# Class Diagram

> Class diagrams clearly map out the structure of a particular system by modelling its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships between objects {cite}`lucidchart_2017_uml`.

Class diagrams are particularly useful when using Object Orientated Programming.

The standard class diagram is composed of three sections:

- **Upper section:** Contains the name of the class. This section is always required.
- **Middle section:** Contains the attributes of the class. Use this section to describe the qualities of the class.
- **Bottom section:** Includes class operations (methods). Displayed in list format, each operation takes up its own line.
