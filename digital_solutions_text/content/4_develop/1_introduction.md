# Develop Phase

## What happens in the Develop Phase

> The develop phase involves students creating new understanding and identifying possible solutions using design, systems, and abstraction and algorithmic computational thinking processes. Students evaluate personal, social and economic impacts, components and digital solutions against criteria throughout the develop phase to make decisions and refine the user experience and technical operation of components of the solution {cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`.

To complete the Develop phase of the EDGE problem solving processes we will need to develop three distinct aspects of the application:

- User Interface
- Programming Components
- Data Structure.

These three aspects reflect the **[](mvc)**.

To do this, we can use the following tools:

- User Interface
  - Sketching
  - Wireframes
  - Mock-ups
  - Prototypes
  - Annotation
- Programming Components
  - Class Diagrams
  - Pseudocode
  - IPO Tables
  - Desk-checking
- Data Structure
  - Data Flow Diagrams
  - Entity Relationship Diagrams
  - Data Dictionaries
  - Relational Schemas
