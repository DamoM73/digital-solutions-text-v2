# Coding &mdash; Unit 1

The first step of your coding will always be setting up a new **[development environment](../2_concepts/2-5_dev_env.md)**.

## Creating MVC Programs

In Unit 1 you will be creating a productivity application (desktop app) using the **[MVC Architecture](mvc)**. The videos below will introduce the concepts behind developing a MVC program using PyQt.

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- Generate user interfaces by investigating and applying useability principles
- Understand and use assignment: used to store the value of an expression into a variable
- Understand and use sequence: a number of instructions processed one after the other
- Understand and use selection: the next instruction to be executed depends on a ‘condition’
- Understand and use condition: a logical expression that evaluates to true or false
- Understand and use iteration: a number of instructions are repeated
- Understand and use modularisation: used for reducing the complexity of a system by deconstructing into more or less independent units or modules
- Recognise, describe and use good programming practices, including dependability, efficiency, testing, debugging, error correction, coding conventions including commenting, consistent naming conventions, code simplicity and portability
- Explore programming development tools to understand how to use them effectively
- Explore the use of a procedural text-based language for writing and modifying code and using existing code blocks or statements
- Explore the use of a procedural text-based language for interpreting programming language rules and syntax
- Explore the use of a procedural text-based language for analysing and critiquing the end result of code statements using input or output evidence, i.e. runtime evidence
- Explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that includes reusable coded components
- Explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that responds to keyboard and mouse events
- Explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that uses variables, selection structures, counted loops, while loops and single, multi-branch and nested conditional logic/statements
- Explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that uses operators, including arithmetic (+, –, *, /, integer, modulus, exponent), comparison (<, >, <=, >=, equal, not equal) and logical (AND, OR, NOT)
- Explore the purpose of code statements by writing code and using existing code blocks or statements
- Explore object/event triggers and develop explanations about their effect/s on user interfaces
- communicate and clarify knowledge and understanding about the purpose of code statements using code comments.
- Apply the use of operators, arithmetic: +, –, *, /, integer, modulus, exponent
- Apply the use of operators, comparison: <, >, <=, >=, equal, not equal
- Apply the use of operators, logical: AND, OR, NOT
- Output information to the screen in text-based or visual formats
- Generate components of a solution by using existing code or writing new code statements
- Generate modified code in response to new or existing information
- Generate functions/procedures with efficient and maintainable code that includes reusable code blocks or statements and responses to keyboard and mouse events
- Generate selection structures, counted loops, while loops, and single, multi-branch and nested conditional logic statements
- Generate local and global variables
- Generate a prototype digital solution in response to a problem
