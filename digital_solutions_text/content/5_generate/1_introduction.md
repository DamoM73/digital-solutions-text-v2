# Generate Phase

## What happens in the Generate Phase?

During the generate phase you will convert the plans from the development phase into code.

You will need to:

- use the **[basic features](../2_concepts/2-1_basic_features.md)** of our programming language (Python).
- apply programming **[good practice](../2_concepts/2-2_good_practice.md)** including testing.
- you will coding using the **[](oop)** and **[](event_driven)** paradigms and the **[](mvc)**.

```{admonition} Tools used to complete the Generate phase:
:class: attention
- Mind Maps
- QT Designer
- Annotated Code
- Integrated Testing Table
- Unit Testing Table
```

```{admonition} To generate solutions, students:
- use design and systems thinking processes to synthesise acquired information, ideas and skills to
  - generate individual components of a preferred solution
  - generate and refine a preferred solution in response to new or existing information
- use design thinking to evaluate and respond to the results of alpha testing
- use systems and design thinking to construct a solution and communicate knowledge and understanding of the solution.{cite}`qcaa_2017_digital`
