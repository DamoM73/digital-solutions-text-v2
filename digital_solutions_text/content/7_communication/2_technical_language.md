```{admonition} Technical Audience vs General Audience
:class: tip
For the majority of your assessment, you will have a technical audience. However, there will be times when you are addressing a general audience. For example, when asking people to provide feedback on your UI, it doesn't make sense to ask then if the UI complies with the safety useability principle. The tester will have no idea what you are talking about, or worse, they will guess based on the general use of *safety*. Rather you should ask questions which explain the meaning of safety. For example, "Could you easily undo an errors you made?".

Using technical language when addressing a technical audience is important for several reasons. First, it facilitates precision and clarity in communication. Technical jargon and terminology are developed within specific fields to describe complex concepts and processes succinctly.

When you use this specialised language, you can convey intricate ideas more accurately and efficiently than with general language. This accuracy is crucial in fields such as engineering, science, and technology, where a minor misunderstanding can lead to significant errors.

Additionally, employing technical language strengthens your credibility and fosters a sense of community among professionals. Specialists in any field develop a deep understanding of the technical language through years of education and experience. When you use this language correctly, it signals your expertise and insider status, building trust with your audience. This shared language also helps in creating a professional identity and solidarity among members of the same field, as it distinguishes them from non-specialists and enhances the cohesion within the community.

In the End material of this website you will find a **[glossary](../glossary.md)** that lists many of the technical terms used during this course. Try to use these terminology ask much as possible.
