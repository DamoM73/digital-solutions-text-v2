# Conventions

Conventions are concerned with the effective use of language and structural elements in written communication, especially within the context of discussing your digital solutions. It emphasises the importance of tailoring your communication to suit the needs and understanding level of specific audiences.

## Language Conventions

This refers to using standard grammar, vocabulary, and stylistic norms of the language to make your message clear and understandable. This means using terminology that:

- is appropriate for a technical audience
- uses a formal tone
- is not in 1st person

## Textual Features

### Annotations

Annotations are notes or comments added to your text to explain and clarify. While you will mostly use annotations in **[explaining UI design decisions](annotating)**, **[code comments](commenting)** and following **[naming conventions](naming_conventions)** can also be considered as annotation of your code

### Paragraphs

Effective use of paragraphs helps in organizing the content logically, making it easier for the audience to follow the discussion. In technical texts the TREEL paragraph structure is not as important as it is in persuasive text, never-the-less, it is important to ensure the each paragraph only deal with one topic.

### Sentences

You sentences should be clearly constructed and vary in structure to maintain the reader's interest. They convey the individual ideas that build up the arguments or descriptions in your text.

## Referencing Conventions

We use the **[APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/beginners)** for referencing. 

The easiest way to create APA style references is to use a citation generator like **[MyBib](https://www.mybib.com/)**.
