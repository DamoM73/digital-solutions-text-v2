# Diagrams

In completing your Digital Solutions projects you will employ a number of diagrams. Some diagrams require following very specific conventions as they are part of an industry protocol or have been prescribed by the QCAA. Other diagrams simply involve expressing your thoughts graphically, so have far more flexibility. It is important to understand which category a diagram falls into and, therefore, what it requires.

These diagrams require you to closely follow conventions:

- **[Empathy Maps](empathy_map)**
- **[Use Case Diagrams](../3_explore/4_use_case_diagram.md)**
- **[Wireframes](wireframe)**
- **[Mock ups](mock-up)**
- **[Class Diagrams](../4_develop/3_class_diagram.md)**
- **[Data Flow Diagrams](../4_develop/7_data_flow_diagram.md)**
- **[Entity Relationship Diagrams](erd)**

These diagrams are flexible in relation to conventions:

- **[Mind Maps](../3_explore/2_mind_map.md)**
- **[Personas](persona)**
- **[UI Sketches](sketching)**
- **[Relational Schemas](rs)**
- **[Data Exchange Diagram](../4_develop/10_data_exchange_diagram.md)**
