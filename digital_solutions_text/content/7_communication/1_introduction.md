# Introduction

Software is now so complex and interconnected, that gone are the days of a solo coder developing code by themselves. Therefore, effective communication is essential for developing any significant piece of software. This communication may be within a work or uni team, or as part of an open source community, or even between different temporally located versions of yourself. The communication component of Digital Solutions reflects this.

To communicate effectively as a modern IT developer, you will need to:

- Use an appropriate technical language
- Use the correct language conventions for the type of text you are creating
- Use diagrams and sketches - both general and industry specific
- Communicate using a range of modes (visual, written and spoken)
- Communicate your ideas through presentation
